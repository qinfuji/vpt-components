Responsive `<Column>` components are constructed using the breakpoint attributes. A breakpoint can be xs, sm, md, lg or xl. Width can be any integer from 1 to 12.

The Design System uses a standard 12-column grid, so at a given breakpoint, columns ending in-3 will be 25% wide (3 of the 12 columns), columns ending in-6 will be 50% wide (6 of the 12 columns), columns ending in-9 will be 75% wide (9 of the 12 columns), and so on.
